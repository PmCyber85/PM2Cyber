# PM2Cyber: A place of learning doctors. 
Welcome! Before you peruse the wares, you need to understand one simple thing. This is a learning and growing outlet where I, the host, am pivoting from Project Management (PMP) into CyberSecurity and all things related. 

Disclaimer: I am in the infancy stage of this realm, and as such, I take everything with that in mind. I will do my level best to do my best, promote myself, learn as much as possible, and strive for the best. Anything you generate, pull, obtain, reference or elicit from this repo should be done at your own risk. I assume no responsibility or accountability. 
With that out of the way, this is a dynamic, living repository, and I welcome everyone to share their opinions and feedbackâ€”good, bad, or indifferent. I only ask that you include a lesson learned, or, in other words, a path forward to address and improve upon anything within this platform.
